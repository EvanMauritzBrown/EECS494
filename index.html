</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>I created the primary slime mechanic utlizing rigidbody forces and weapon movements.</p>
<p>I also created addditional sounds and music for the level as well as built the first half of rooms.</p>
<p>For the main game I mostly did player work including all movement and weapons, and specific rooms and UI.</p>
<p>This was all built using C# and Unity.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a horror platformer game I created for project 2. In it, the player must navigate a haunted mansion before the ghost gets them</p>
<p> while using their flashlight to prevent the ghost from manipulating parts of the environment.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is purrgatory, a metroidvania-style combat platformer where you play a cat on its journey through the Egyptian underworld.</p>
<p>It can be played alone or with a friend, bounce off walls and enemies to collect new abilities and collect the heart scarab.</p>
<p>I did a bit of everything on this project. I made art like the Anubis, Apep, soul orb, etc..., I did music such as the desert theme, Apep fight song, Necromancer fight song, etc...</p>
<p>Finally, I did a great deal in the codebase. I worked primarily on core systems like singlehandedly making the save/load data system. I also made the Apep boss, did jungle level design, new upgrades, ...</p>
<p>This was developed in Unity and C# with level design using LDtK.</p>
