<h3>Details</h3>

<p>I created the primary slime mechanic utlizing rigidbody forces and weapon movements.</p>
<p>I also created addditional sounds and music for the level as well as built the first half of rooms.</p>
<p>For the main game I mostly did player work including all movement and weapons, and specific rooms and UI.</p>
<p>This was all built using C# and Unity.</p>
